FuelDrop is a cutting-edge, React-powered fuel delivery platform that redefines how users refuel their vehicles. By bridging the gap between fuel stations and consumers, it offers an on-demand service that is both convenient and transparent.

## 🚀 The Problem & Solution

**The Problem:** Traditional refueling often involves long wait times, inconvenient detours, and lack of real-time tracking for businesses managing multiple vehicles.

**The Solution:** FuelDrop brings the fuel station to the user. Whether it's a single car at home or a fleet at a warehouse, FuelDrop provides a seamless ordering experience with real-time tracking, secure authentication, and comprehensive order history.
