   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

### Getting Started
1. Launch the app and view the splash screen
2. Enter your mobile number and verify with OTP (use "1234" for demo)
3. Set up your profile and add vehicles
4. Start ordering fuel!

### Key Workflows

**Ordering Fuel**:
- Select a vehicle from your garage
- Choose fuel quantity (liters) or amount (rupees)
- Review price breakdown and proceed to checkout
- Confirm order and track delivery in real-time

**Managing Vehicles**:
- Add new vehicles with make, model, and fuel type
- Edit existing vehicle details
- Remove vehicles you no longer need

**Tracking Orders**:
- View current order status and captain details
- Monitor ETA and delivery progress
- Rate your experience after completion

### Demo Features
This is a demonstration application with simulated features:
- OTP verification accepts "1234" as a valid code
- All data is stored locally in your browser
- Payment processing is UI-only
- Location services use browser geolocation or defaults
- Delivery tracking is simulated with timed status updates
